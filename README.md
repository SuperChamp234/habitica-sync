# Habitica Sync in Obsidian
This plugin for Obsidian incorporates a view to display and interact with the task management app Habitica.

Please open issues for any bugs/functionality requests :)

## Usage
The plugin's view is enabled by clicking on the "Open Habitica Pane" option in the side ribbon (default hotkey is `Ctrl+Shift+H`). 

To sync your Habitica account, go to the settings page of the plugin and enter your user ID and API token credentials.
## Features

## Settings

The following two inputs help fetch your user data to be displayed in the Obsidian view:
- **Habitica User ID:** You can find this by clicking on the "User" icon in the top right of the Habitica webapp, "Settings", then "API"
- **Habitica Token API:** You can find this by clicking on the "User" icon in the top right of the Habitica webapp, "Settings", then "API"


## Roadmap
We will be implementing additional features including:
- Add/delete/customize tasks and habits

# Habitica Sync in Obsidian
This plugin for Obsidian incorporates a view to display and interact with the task management app Habitica.

Please open issues for any bugs/functionality requests :)

## Usage
The plugin's view is enabled by clicking on the "Open Habitica Pane" option in the side ribbon (default hotkey is `Ctrl+Shift+H`). 

To sync your Habitica account, go to the settings page of the plugin and enter your user ID and API token credentials.
